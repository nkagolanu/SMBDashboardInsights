AI-Powered Risk Insights Dashboard

1. Overview

1.1 Problem Statement

As Pipe transitions from a marketplace model to direct underwriting in embedded finance, managing risk exposure across platforms (Priority, Boulevard, Housecall Pro, etc.) has become increasingly complex. Unlike traditional lending, Pipe's revenue-based financing model lacks fixed repayment schedules, making it difficult to assess default risk using conventional metrics.

The Risk Team needs an AI-driven dashboard that provides:

Portfolio Overview – A high-level snapshot of active advances, repayment performance, and risk exposure across all embedded finance partners.

Vintage & Cohort Analysis – The ability to drill down into platform-specific loan performance over time, identifying trends and optimizing underwriting strategies.

Default & Risk Analysis – AI-powered tracking of non-traditional default risk metrics, ensuring early detection of at-risk SMBs and proactive funding strategy adjustments.
