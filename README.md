### Purpose

The **Risk Insights Dashboard** provides a real-time view of loan performance across embedded finance platforms. It helps the Risk Team track total lending activity, repayment trends, and emerging risks using three key risk categories: 
    **Liquidity Risk, Revenue Drop Risk, and Non-Payment Risk.**

With this dashboard, users can:

✅ **Monitor outstanding lending activity** across platforms with high-level metrics (total loans, fees, and loan distribution).  
✅ **Analyze loan vintages** to assess repayment trends over time.  
✅ **Identify early warning signs** using risk metrics tailored for revenue-based financing.  

This enables **data-driven underwriting adjustments** and **proactive risk mitigation** to optimize Pipe's lending strategy.
